# for loops in Java

## Tasks

### Basic loops
Create while loops to achieve the following requirements:

* Start with the number 3 and double it. Double the result until it exceeds 100.
* Count down from 10 (include 0).

### Advanced Examples
* Print the multiplication tables (1 through 10) for all numbers from 1 to 10
